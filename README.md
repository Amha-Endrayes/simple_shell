About this project



This project is a simple version of the linux shell made for  Alx software Engineering program in collaboration with Holberton School taking part of the "Low-level programming & Algorithm - Linux and Unix system programming" projects.

It is created using the C programming Language and it can do many functionalities that a real shell does.

Essential Functionalities of the Simple Shell:

Displays a prompt "#cisfun$ " and waits for user input.

Runs all commands of type "executable program" (ls and /bin/ls).

Runs the following build_in commands: exit, env, setenv and unsetenv.

Handles commands with arguments.

Handles the PATH global variable.

Handles The EOF (End Of File) condition.

Handles the Ctrl + C signal -> It doesn't exit the shell

Step 1: Clone our repository using this command on your vagrant machine.


git clone https://github.com/Amha-Endrayes/simple_shell

Step 2: Change directory to simple_shell:


cd simple_shell

Step 3: Compile the C files in this way:


gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic *.c -o hsh.

Step 4: Run the shell.
